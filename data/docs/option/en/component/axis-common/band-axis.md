#${prefix} trimPadding(boolean)

Supported since `1.7.0` version, used to configure whether to remove the white space at both ends of the band axis. If true, there will be no white space at both ends, **and the settings of bandPadding, paddingInner and paddingOuter will be ignored**.

#${prefix} bandPadding(number|number[])
default value is `0.2`.

**Only valid when the axis is a discrete axis**, used to set `paddingInner` and `paddingOuter` of the axis at the same time, the value is between (0,1), the priority is lower than `paddingInner` and `paddingOuter`.

**Because there may be multi-layer scales (xField is set to an array, that is, a grouping scene), the array type is supported for bandPadding configuration of multi-layer scales**

#${prefix} paddingInner(number|number[])
default value is `0.1`.

**Only takes effect when the axis is a discrete axis**, the interval within the axis group, the value is between (0,1), and the priority is higher than `bandPadding`.

** Because there may be multi-layer scales (xField is set to an array, that is, a grouping scene), the array type is supported, which is used for the paddingInner configuration of multi-layer scales. **

#${prefix} paddingOuter(number|number[])
default value is `0.3`.

**Only effective when the axis is a discrete axis**, the interval outside the axis group, the value is between (0,1), and the priority is higher than `bandPadding`.

**Because there may be multi-layer scales (xField is set to an array, that is, a grouping scene), the array type is supported for the paddingOuter configuration of multi-layer scales.**

#${prefix} domain(array)

**Only valid when the axis is a discrete axis**, configure the value range of the discrete axis.

#${prefix} bandSize(number)

**Only valid when the axis is a discrete axis**, configure the fixed band width of the discrete axis. Supported since version `1.4.0`.

The visual effect is that regardless of the size of the chart container, the distance between the ticks on the axis remains unchanged (if it is a bar chart, the column width also remains unchanged).

#${prefix} maxBandSize(number)

**Only valid when the axis is a discrete axis**, configure the maximum band width of the discrete axis. Supported since version `1.4.0`.

Since the chart will display all the ticks in the container proportionally by default, the automatically calculated band width will also increase proportionally when the chart container becomes bigger. When the automatically calculated band width is larger than `maxBandSize`, the band width will maintain the value of `maxBandSize`.

When `bandSize` is already configured, `maxBandSize` will no longer take effect.

#${prefix} minBandSize(number)

**Only valid when the axis is a discrete axis**, configure the minimum band width of the discrete axis. Supported since version `1.4.0`.

Since the chart will display all the ticks in the container proportionally by default, the automatically calculated band width will also decrease proportionally when the chart container becomes smaller. When the automatically calculated band width is less than `minBandSize`, the band width will maintain the value of `minBandSize`.

When `bandSize` is already configured, `minBandSize` will no longer take effect.

#${prefix} autoRegionSize(boolean)

**Only valid when the axis is a discrete axis**ï¼Œconfigure whether to automatically calculate region width or height based on band size. Supported since version `1.4.0`.

This configuration only takes effect when `bandSize` or `maxBandSize` has already been configured.

#${prefix} showAllGroupLayers(boolean)=false

Supported since version `1.9.0`, **only takes effect when the axis is a discrete axis**. When there is a multi-layer grouping scene, whether to display all grouping axes, it is turned off by default.

#${prefix} layers(object[])

Supported since `1.9.0` version, **takes effect only when `showAllGroupLayers` configuration is turned on**, used for the related configuration of each layer axis, layer[0] is the axis closest to the coordinate axis, the specific configuration is as follows :

##${prefix} visible(boolean)=true

Whether to display.

##${prefix} tickStep(number)

tick step size.

##${prefix} tickStep(number)

tick step size.

##${prefix} tickCount(number|function) = 5

The recommended number of ticks does not guarantee that the result will be the configured value.
After version `1.4.0`, **in continuous axis**, `tickCount` supports configuration as a function, which is usually used to dynamically configure the number of ticks. The function is defined as follows:

```ts
tickCount?: (option: {
   axisLength?: number; //The size of the canvas occupied by the coordinate axis. The width or height of the axis in the rectangular coordinate system, and the length of the radial axis in the polar coordinate system.
   labelStyle?: ITextGraphicAttribute; // Style of axis label
}) => number;
```

##${prefix} forceTickCount(number)

The forcibly set number of ticks can ensure that the number of ticks matches the set value, but the tick value may be a decimal due to the data range.
