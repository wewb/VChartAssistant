#${prefix} startRelativeSeriesIndex(number)

Starting point associated series index (only valid in the axis target: coordinate space).

#${prefix} startRelativeSeriesId(string)

Starting point associated series ID (only valid in the axis target: coordinate space).

#${prefix} endRelativeSeriesIndex(number)

Ending point associated series index (only valid in the axis target: coordinate space).

#${prefix} endRelativeSeriesId(string)

#${prefix} relativeRelativeSeriesIndex(number)

The series index associated with the marked data (default is using the first valid series in the current region).

#${prefix} relativeRelativeSeriesId(string)

The series ID associated with the marked data (default is using the first valid series in the current region).

#${prefix} specifiedDataSeriesIndex(string|number|array)
Since the `1.11.0` version, data processing needs to be associated with series separately. When configured as 'all', it means that all series under the current region are associated.
